Chat bots with different levels of intellectuality. Only the most basic (using only default library functionality) uploaded so far.

To run:

    cp config.py.sample config.py
    
Then edit the new file and add the Telegram API token there

And, finally (in case of python 3.6, but can run with other python3 installations as well)

    python3.6 bot.py
